# Q2 CTF

This repository contains useful files for Quake 2 (Remaster) CTF (Capture the Flag).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Quake 2 from Steam

You need to install Quake 2. The best way is to get it from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2320/Quake_II/).

The game was remastered in 2023. When you install the Steam version, you automatically get the remastered version with CTF mode included.

### 2. Copy Files

Next, add a couple of useful files to make your game a little easier.

The easiest approach is to copy all files from the `./baseq2` folder to your local baseq2 folder.

On Windows machines, this is typically located at:

```
C:\Users\<user_name>\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake II\baseq2
```

## What You're Getting

1. **mac.cfg** - Custom config file
2. **ctfserver.cfg** - Config file to host a CTF game
3. **pak1.pak** - Custom pak with "full-bright" skins for CTF and weapons for better visibility
4. **./maps** - Most popular CTF maps
5. **./sound** - Timer sounds for Quad Damage, Armor, and Power Shield
